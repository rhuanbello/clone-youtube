# YouTube Clone

## 📖 About

This was my attempt to clone the YouTube interface using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It's all just for fun!

Recently I was asked for a simple video page that used the concepts of Flexbox to position elements. After completing the challenge, I decided to take a few more steps and improve the project to make it a YouTube interface clone.

With the Don't Repeat Yourself concept in mind, I made the whole project run on a single page manipulated by JavaScript, which is responsible for updating the source and the description of the videos depending on which video the user selects, and hide/show the sidebar and main to highlight the video :D

I'll be back on this project soon to improve it more and more :)
